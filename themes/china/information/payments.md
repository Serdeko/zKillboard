There are two methods of paying.

- Include your account name in the reason code. E.g. if your login is <strong>squizz</strong>, then include <strong>squizz</strong> in the payment reason. Must be an exact match!
- Have an <a href="/account/api/"">API tied to your account</a> that includes the character you sent the ISK from.

# Subdomain
To make a payment for a subdomain, all you have to do is include the <strong>URL</strong>, and only the <strong>URL</strong> of the subdomain in the payment reason.
